the stages of azure devops	
	1. plan
	2. develop
	3. delivery/deployment
	4. Operations
	
	planning:
	 for any requirement , time it takes, schedule , cost estimation
	 programming language
	 database 
	 platform
	 roles of resources
	 how to plan testing
	 visual sessions using dash boards
	 
	jira
	
	
development:
 based on architecture, developers create source code
  after the code is created , they will manage the source code repository
  azure repository
  
  git hub: remote repository  and git: local repo
	centralised n distributed Source code is there
  
  
  testing QA , UAT
  
  delivery : to increase the frequency of release
  
  operations: continous monitoring/ maintenance
  feedbacks 
  zero downtime and sopeed shud be higher
  
  
  
  1. build and maintin back log(pending task )
  user stories/task : 
  
  2. host code repo
  azure supports 2 types of repos:
  centralised : 
  central server, repo is there on that server. developer shud login to the central server
  whole data will be lost if repo is deleted
  TFVC(team foundation version control)
 
  
  
  distributed: 
	remote repo can be cloned
  once changes are done.push the changes to remote repos
  no need to always online
  remote server clone is available
  
 git hub
 
 3. achieve CI
 4. achieve CD
  azure pipeline
  
 5. automate testing
	azure test plan. 
6. implement CI /CD pipeline from code in to code deployemnt
	Az artifacts(executable)
 
 
 azure boards:
 1. manage software project
 2. supports scrum and kanban method 
 3.customise the dash boards
 4. create reports
 5. trace user stories, backlog items, bugs associated with the project
