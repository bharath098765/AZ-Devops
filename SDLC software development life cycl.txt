monolithic approach:
we cannot work on modules
everything is tightly coupled(lots of dependencies on each other)
modules cannot be independently developed, tested or deployed
it is linear in nature

agile method:
module1/ iteration1:
	requirement analysis 
	design
	coding/ development
	testing 
	implementation/deployment
	maintenance/monitoring

module2/ iteration2:
	requirement analysis 
	design
	coding/ development
	testing 
	implementation/deployment
	maintenance/monitoring

in agile , new requirements can be accomodated
we can design, code, test but cannot deploy automatically.

we can achieve continous development
continuous integration
continuous testing
continuous delivery
but continuous deployment is not possible.

Difference between continous delivery and continous deployment:
when manual approval is needed for the release , then it is continous delivery
when release of application is automated, then it z mcontinuous deployment

why manual intervention is needed for releasing to prod env?
agile method follows task based approach
at last , iterations will be thoroughly reviewed
and it will be deployed to prod environment

Devops :it is same as agile method, but from day 1 proper collaboration between tesms
complete transparency is there.

no flaw in app

teams have collaboratedto achieve continous development, continous integration, continous testing, continous deployment, continous monitoring in fully automated fashion

what is devops?
it is a software development stratergy which helps to promote the collaboration between teams 
everything is achieved using automated tools 
time savoing approach 

teams involved in SDLC:

devops team : 
	infra team
	app development team
	testing 
	release management
	production support team
	prod monitor team 
	security team

Devops stages: 
	continous development 
	continous integration
	continous testing
	continous delivery 
	continous deployment
	contionus monitoring
