Azure pipeline flow:

	SCM checkout
	azure repos
	Azure test plans
	azure pipelines
	azure web app
	azure application insights(this gives feedback)
	review
	coding


Az pipeline benefits:
	it can work with any language
	can deploy at diff env at the same time 
	integrates withn azure deploymentas
	built on windows, mac Os, Linux
	integrate with gity Hub
	work with open source projects
	
Agents:
 they are the VMs where we run our pipelines
 gitlab runners, github actions, az pipelines
 
 Types :
	Hosted agent: the agents which are provided by cloud provider
	private agent : these are the vms which we can create and install all required tools 
					we are the sole controller of this
					
Build Agent:
	Vm which run build process
	it is used to build n deploy the code
	it can be MS hosted or Self hosted
	Build agents can be either on the host machine or in container
	Runs one job at a time
	
MS hosted Agents:
	the vm will b discarded after one use to free up the resources
	every time you run a pipeline, u will get a fresh Vm
	user have to provide build configurations
	MS take care of the maintenance , upgradation for u
	
limitations of MS hosted agents:
	Build duration can be for 6 Hrs
	limited Disk space 
	user can not sign in the hosted agent
	
	
self hosted agent:
	more control to the user for build n deploymentas
	user can customise the environment as per app requirement
	user can take snap shot 
	cache is available
	
	
agent pool: multiple agent servers are called agent pool. 
			when any agent is unhealthy, we can re route the traffic
			
		
in agents, either we can work in sequence or parallel 


vm1: java based
vm2: python
vm3: .net

if no agents are available, job will be in waiting state.

load balancing: a process of traffic distribution in case of heavy inbound traffic. round robin


agent pool is used :
	load balancing
	to provide needed dependencies to the job
	
microsoft hosted CI/CD
	hosted agents will be needed to run the job
	if u want run job, u need to use parallel jobs
	
	yaml:
	
	pipeline
	stage
	job
	steps
