Devops stages: 
	continous development :
	
		it is the capacity of the team to continously develop the product as per business requirement.
		without devops day to day activity:
		coding
		build the code
		testing
		create artifacts
		promote changes to higher env for further development
		notify team to pick the code
		
		devops`: 
		code the application-->improve the productivity
		
		automated
		build the code(compiling the code )
		testing
		create artifacts(binaries which are executable to target environment)
		promote changes to higher env for further development
		notify team to pick the code(slack)
		
	continous integration
		it is the capacity of the development team to continously integrate the code for production environment
	
	continous testing
		this is most important phase
		automation
	
	continous delivery
		manual approval is needed
		banking application
		they take areound 4 to 6 hrs of non bzness hrs
		
	continous deployment
		netflix, prime
		no downtime
		automated
		matured level of devops
		
	contionus monitoring
		two type of monitoring
			infra level monitoring
				www. aha.com
				the page is not responding
				their network problem
				netwrok traffic
				memory, cpu utilisation
			
			application level monitoring
				bug in application
				
	Devops tools:
		development:
		 For this we use IDE(integrated development environment):
		  VS code, VS, Pycharm
		  these tools improve the productivity of developers to code better
		  
		aftr code is biuilt , thenm it can be integrated to SCR(source code repository) like github
		once the code is updated, we use CI tools like jenkins , gitlab- CI
		
	testing : selenium
	CD: orchestration tools like k8 for deployment, docker swarm
	 container: indepedent OS
	
	monitoring:
		prometheus, grafana, cloud watch (by AWS), azure monitor
		

categorise the tools:

	open source tools/self managed tools(installation, security is our responsibility)
		jenkins
		gitlab
		github
		bitbucket
		Docker
		kubernetes
		prometheus 
		gragana, data dog
	managed tools(cloud provider take care of installation, security)
		AWS: infrastructure services
		Azure: dedicated devops services
		GCP
